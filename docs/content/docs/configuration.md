# Configuration

The `APITest` configuration type exposes some methods to register test hooks, enabled debug logging and to define the handler under test.

## Handler

Define the handler that should be tested as follows, where `myHandler` is a `http.Handler`

```go
apitest.New().
	Handler(myHandler)
```

When setting a handler `apitest` does not make a http call over the network. Instead the provided http handler's `ServeHTTP` method is invoked in the same process as the test code. The user defined request and response structs are converted to `http.Request` and `http.Response` types via Go's `httptest` package. The goal here is to test the internal application and not the networking layer. This approach keeps the test fast simple. If you would like to use a real http client to generate a request against a running application you should enable networking.

## Enable Networking

If you want to generate HTTP requests against a running application you should enable networking. Passing a http client with a configured cookie jar allows browser like session behaviour where cookies are preserved across multiple `apitest` requests.

```go
cookieJar, _ := cookiejar.New(nil)
httpClient := &http.Client{
    Jar: cookieJar,
}

apitest.New().
	EnableNetworking(httpClient).
	Post("/login")
	...

apitest.New().
	EnableNetworking(httpClient).
	Get("/authenticated_route")
	...
```

This approach can be useful for performing end-to-end tests.

## Debug Output

Enabling debug logging will write the http wire representation of all request and response interactions to the console.

```go
apitest.New().
	Debug().
	Handler(myHandler)
```

This will also log mock interactions. This can be useful for identifying the root cause behind test failures related to unmatched mocks. In this example the mocks do not match due to an incorrect URL in the mock definition. The request is compared with each registered mock and the reason is logged to the console for each mock mismatch

```text
----------> inbound http request
GET /user HTTP/1.1
Host: application

failed to match mocks. Errors: received request did not match any mocks

Mock 1 mismatches:
• received path /user/12345 did not match mock path /preferences/12345

Mock 2 mismatches:
• received path /user/12345 did not match mock path /user/123456

----------> request to mock
GET /user/12345 HTTP/1.1
Host: localhost:8080
User-Agent: Go-http-client/1.1
Accept-Encoding: gzip
...

```

## Hooks

### Observe

`Observe` can be used to inspect the request, response and `APITest` instance when the test completes. This method is used internally within `apitest` to capture all interactions that cross the mock server which enables rendering of the test results. 

```go
apitest.New().
	Observe(func(res *http.Response, req *http.Request, apiTest *apitest.APITest) {
		// do something with res and req
	}).
}
```

### Intercept

This is similar to `Observe` but is invoked pre request, allowing the implementer to mutate the request object before it is sent to the system under test. In this example we set the request params with a custom scheme

```go
apitest.New().
	Handler(handler).
	Intercept(func(req *http.Request) {
	    req.URL.RawQuery = "a[]=xxx&a[]=yyy"
	}).
```
