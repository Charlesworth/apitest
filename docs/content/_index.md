# Getting started

## Overview

A simple and extensible behavioural testing library for Go. You can use `apitest` to simplify testing of REST based services or HTTP handlers. 

`apitest` supports mocking external http calls and renders sequence diagrams on test completion.

## Installation

Using `go get`

```bash
go get -u github.com/steinfletcher/apitest
```

Using `dep`

```bash
dep ensure -add github.com/steinfletcher/apitest
```

apitest is tested against Go `1.11.x` and `stable` and follows semantic versioning managed through GitHub releases.

## Anatomy of a test

A test consists of three main parts

- [Configuration]({{< relref "/docs/configuration.md" >}}): defines the `http.handler` that will be tested and any specific test configurations, such as mocks, debug mode and reporting
- [Request]({{< relref "/docs/request.md" >}}): defines the test input. This is typically a http request
- [Assertions]({{< relref "/docs/assertions.md" >}}): defines how the application under test should respond. This is typically a http response

```go
func TestGetUser(t *testing.T) {
	apitest.New().                              // configuration
		Handler(newApp().app).
		Get("/user/1234").                      // request
		Expect(t).
		Body(`{"id": "1234", "name": "Andy"}`). // expectations
		Status(http.StatusOK).
		End()
}
```
